# This file contains an example Excution sequence to illustrate the usage of the module.

# Install the module

#Import the module

# Define an new array of type [ExecutionStep[]]
[ExecutionStep[]]$ExecutionSteps = @()

# ExecutionStep can be created in multiple ways

# 1) Splatting:
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_splatting?view=powershell-7.3
# Create a new execution step with a precondition
# This step will run normally, not be skipped (as Precondition ist $true), not produce any erorrs and be recovered if a later step produces
# a terminal error
$secondStepError

# Define a HashTable

  ErrorMsg        = 'Error Message'
}


# Create the step with New-ExecutionStep
$firstStep = New-ExecutionStep @myFistInstallStep

# Add the step to the array
$ExecutionSteps += $firstStep

# 2) Use parameters with New-ExecutionStep
# This step will run normally, not be skipped (as Precondition has not been set), not produce any erorrs and be recovered if a later step produces
# a terminal error

# Add the step to the array
